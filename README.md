Project Manager-

Step 1-Word Selection:
Choose a word randomly from a predefined list or from an external text file.
Display the chosen word to the console for testing purposes, but hide it from the player.

Step 2-Guessing Mechanism:
Implement a function to process the player's guess.
Check if the guessed letter is in the word.
Update the display to reveal correct guesses and update the hangman state for incorrect guesses.

Step 3-Winning and Losing Conditions:
Determine the winning condition: if the player successfully guesses all letters in the word before the hangman is complete.
Determine the losing condition: if the hangman is complete before the word is guessed.

Step 4-Game Logic:
Develop the core game logic to handle player input, word checking, updating the display, and determining game outcomes.
Ensure smooth progression of the game based on player actions.

Step 5-Graphics and Animations:
Keep the graphics simple for the hangman stages (stick figure).
Optionally, implement animations using Tkinter's canvas or other methods to show the progression of the hangman.

Step 6-Sound Effects and Feedback:
Optionally, add sound effects for correct and incorrect guesses.
Provide visual feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was correct or not.

Step 7-Testing and Debugging:
Test the game thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
Debug any issues or bugs that arise during testing.

Step 8-Documentation:
Provide basic documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each function and how to run the game.
